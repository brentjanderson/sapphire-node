# Node Backbone Sample Project #

It is a sample project for a Node/HTML5 application optimized separately for desktop browsers (web), generic mobile platforms using jQuery Mobile (jquerymobile) and iPhone (iphone). Its server side project is based on [robrighter / node-boilerplate](https://github.com/robrighter/node-boilerplate) and its client side projects are based on [ccoenraets / backbone-directory](https://github.com/ccoenraets/backbone-directory).

## The Application ##

It is a simple Employee Directory application that allows you to look up employees by name, view the details of an employee, and navigate up and down the Org Chart by clicking the employeeâ€™s manager or any of his/her direct reports.

There are four versions of the application available in this repository:

1. Backbone.js + Twitter Bootstrap (located in the [/web](https://github.com/vinkaga/node-backbone/tree/master/web) directory). This version adds primitive chat to the pages.

	<h1>What is Sapphire?</h1>
	<p>Sapphire is a meager attempt to recreate the magic of the <a href="http://spacecamputah.org">Space Center</a> in Pleasant Grove on the web.</p>
	<p>While many aspects of a live mission cannot be recreated in-browser only, the hope is that stories truly are the key to an educational and engaging experience.</p>
	<h1>What's Sapphire made of?</h1>
	<p>In an attempt to be really cool, Sapphire is built on NodeJS, ExpressJS, Socket.IO, EJS, and a score of other libraries. Special thanks goes to everyone that has contributed to these projects.</p>
	<p>An extra special thank you is in order to Vinay Agarwal for putting together <a target="_BLANK" href="https://github.com/vinkaga/node-backbone">node-backbone</a> on GitHub.</p>

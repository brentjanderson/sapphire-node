		<p>Well this will have to do for the news section for now. I think I'm getting the hang of Backbone.js and how it fits in with the overall architecture. There is definitely a big learning curve on all this, but it's good and I feel like I'm learning some incredible stuff.</p>
		<p>Next up is creating an administration panel for creating simulators and adding stations to them. I'm tempted to use Sprint.ly to manage it, but I think I may instead just use GitHub issues. We'll see.</p>
		<p>At any rate, I've got to get it so I can log in/log out and maintain</p>
